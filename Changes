Revision history for Perl extension Mad.

0.3  Wed Jun  8 00:01:00 2002
	- split Mad::Dither code into Mad::Resample and Mad::Dither.
	  both of which work on naitve mad_fixed_t streams and 
	  return data wrapped in plain SV's.  I'm not entirely sure
	  I'm treating SV's correctly in this module,  if you see
	  me being stupid -- please tell me so I can fix it.
	  
	- interface work is mostly complete,  a few touchups,  
	  segfault fixes (damn buffer handling) and a bit of 
	  documentation added.  this is ready for alpha release,  imho.
	  it is capable of taking raw mp3 input data and returning data
	  suitable to be sent at /dev/dsp.

0.2  Wed Jun  5 12:00:00 2002
	- created perl package Mad::Dither from code found in
	  the mad source distribution.  it preforms generic
	  dithering and linear resampling on data derived from
	  mad_synth to provide raw pcm data to perl script.

0.1  Sat Jun  1 12:00:00 2002
	- created perl interfaces for:  mad_stream,  mad_frame,
	  mad_synth,  and mad_timer (in Mad::Stream, Mad::Frame, etc..).

	- original version; created by h2xs 1.21 with options
		-a -n Mad -x /usr/include/mad.h -lmad
